# NASA Task Organizer App

## Project Idea

The NASA Task Organizer App is inspired by productivity and workload tools used at NASA, such as the NASA Task Load Index (TLX). This app provides a streamlined way to manage tasks and to-dos for science, research, mission planning, or personal productivity. In spaceflight, research, and aerospace operations, clear tracking and timely execution of critical tasks are essential to mission success, safety, and efficiency. An organizer like this can help NASA staff, astronauts, or engineers ensure that no vital procedure is missed, and provide quick access to task status during high-stakes work environments[web:4][web:11].

The app is simple, lightweight, and works offline, suitable for fast-paced or constrained environments typical of NASA fieldwork and missions. For students or space enthusiasts, the app is an example of how digital tools can improve time management and operational readiness for complex projects.

## Technologies/Tools Used

- **HTML5**: The structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling and theming the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles interactive features: adding, marking as complete, and deleting tasks.
- **No frameworks or server required**: Pure client-side code, easy to modify or deploy.

## How to Run or Use the Project

1. **Download or clone this repository.**
2. Ensure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
4. Use the input field to add new tasks.
5. Click on any task to mark it as complete (crossed out).
6. Use the "Delete" button on any task to remove it from the list.

No installation or internet connection is required. This makes the app portable and reliableâ€”even in network-limited environments such as field operations or remote research bases.

For future improvements, the app can be extended to support NASA TLX scoring, mission-based task grouping, alerts, or data export, providing even greater value for scientific and operational use[web:4][web:11].
